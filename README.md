![Jeeves](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jkl204/JeevesFiler/master/Jeeves.bmp)

The general purpose of this project was to create a simple application for personal use that can rename batches of files located in specific folders, already in some kind of order, either lex. / date / size.

Feel free to tailor this program to your needs, under the MIT lisc.
